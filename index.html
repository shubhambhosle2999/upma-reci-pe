    <h4>Instructions</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Preparation</li>
        <ol>
            <li>Finaly chop 1 medium sized onion, 1 to 2 green chillies and 1 inch ginger and some coriander leaves.</li>
            <li>Also set aside the remaining ingredients.</li>
        </ol>
       <li> Roasting Rava</li>
        <ol>
            <li>Heat a pan or kadai first.add rava or crean of wheat.</li>
            <li>Being to roast the rava . stir often while roasting the rava.</li>
            <li>the rava or sooji grains should become fragrant and start to look dry , separete and crisp.</li>
            <li>swith off the flame and then add the roasted rava in aplate and keep aside</li>
        </ol>
       <li> Frying And Sauteing</li>
       <ol>
        <li>In a pan ,heat ghee or oil.add the mustard seeds.</li>
        <li>When you hear the crackling sound of mustard seeds ,it means they are getting fried</li>
        <li>Now add the ½ teaspoon cumin seeds along with 1 teaspoon chana dal (husked and split bengal gram) and 1 teaspoon urad dal (husked and split black gram).</li>
        <li>Stirring often fry until the chana dal and urad dal begin to brown a bit.</li>
        <li> Immediately add 10 to 12 cashews and begin to fry on a low to medium-low heat.</li>
        <li>Now add the finely chopped onions. Sauté the onions until they soften and become translucent on a low to medium-low heat.</li>
        <li> Then add the chopped green chillies, ginger and curry leaves. You can also add 1 dried red chilli at this step.</li>
       </ol>
       <li>Boiling Water</li>
       <ol>
        <li>Then add 2.5 cups water to this mixture.Add salt as required. Mix well and check the taste of water. It should be a bit salty but not too much.</li>
        <li>Then add 1 teaspoon sugar. Sugar is optional and you can skip it. We prefer a slight sweet taste in the upma and hence we add it.</li>
        <li>Stir again. On a medium to high flame, heat the water and let it come to a rolling boiling.</li>
       </ol>
       <li>Making Upma</li>
       <ol>
        <li>When the water comes to a rolling boil, lower the flame to its lowest. Then add the rava in 4 to 5 batches with a spoon.</li>
        <li>Once you add the first batch of rava, stir and mix immediately so that the roasted rava gets mixed evenly with the water.</li>
        <li> Then add the next batch of rava. Mix and stir again very well ensuring that the batch of rava is mixed evenly in water.</li>
        <li>Continue to add and stir the rava up to the last batch. Quickly stir and mix very well. The rava grains will absorb water, swell and get cooked.</li>
        <li>Cover and allow the rava upma to steam for 2 to 3 minutes on a low heat.</li>
        <li>Then switch off the heat. In the below photo, the rava is cooked well and the suji ka upma is ready.</li>
        <li>Lastly add about 2 tablespoons chopped coriander leaves (cilantro). You can add more coriander leaves if you like.</li>
        <li> Mix again.Serve upma hot or warm with slices of lemon or a side of lemon pickle or coconut chutney. You can opt to drizzle half to one teaspoon of ghee while serving. If you like you can garnish with some coriander leaves.</li>
       </ol>
